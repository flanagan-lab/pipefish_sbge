# Sex-biased gene expression in the genus _Stigmatopora_

In this directory we have scripts and data associated with the analysis of transcriptome data from three species of pipefish in the genus _Stigmatopora_ including the wide-bodied pipefish (_Stigmatopora nigra_), the spotted pipefish (_Stigmatopora argus_), and the long-snouted pipefish (_Stigmatopora macropterygia_).

Additional details pertaining to the analyses conducted for each species can be found in each sub_directory's README files.
