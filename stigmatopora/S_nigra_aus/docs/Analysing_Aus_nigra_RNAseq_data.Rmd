This pipeline follows a pipeline outlined for _Syngnathus floridae_. Changes in scripts and outputs are outlined in this document. More detail about the programmes used can be found here:https://github.com/coley-tosto/PhD_thesis/blob/main/Chapter_3/docs/Analyzing_floridae_RNAseq_data_from_MSU.Rmd This pipeline was run on the University of Canterbury's RCC.
