## Issues with getting into the RCC
Initially when trying to log in to the RCC using `ssh rccuser@132.181.102.28` there was an issue where it was asking me to enter a password in order to access the RCC. However, this RCC was set-up specifically so no password would be required. We were able to fix this with the following steps:\

1. Find your real WSL home directory with `echo "$HOME"`\

2. Copy the folder that contains your .ssh key to the WSL home directory `cp -r /mnt/c/Users/nicol/.ssh /home/ntosto`

3. Change file permissions so that you can access the .ssh key using **chmod**\
`chmod 0744 /home/ntosto/.ssh`\
`chmod 0600 /home/ntosto/.ssh/id_ed25519` (the id_ed25519 will not be the exact same for everyone)\

4. After running those two commands you should now be able to access the RCC with the normal `ssh rccuser@...` 

## Creating a Shell script
Creating a [shell script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo7xL6s79K4&list=PLLV_tmUM69VA4B0DKfNEBsaL9ARlpp__W&index=15) is useful when you are wanting to utilize a certain pipeline, or command, many different times without having to re-type or memorize what was done before. It can be done using the command `nano`.

 1. Using **nano** tell the command line what type of file you are wanting to create.\
 `nano filename.sh`\
     - This opens a file editor where we can now add our code/pipeline
2. Add `#!/bin/bash` at the beginning of the script. This tells the computer what to use to execute the script.
3. Each line in the script is a different command, they will be run one after the other.
     - If you want to have something go onto a second line but still be one command add "\" at the end of each line.
4. Before you can run the script, you must make sure you have executable permissions (see section about how to do that).


## Transfering files from laptop to the RCC and vice versa
This can be done using the command **sftp** which is a secure transfer protocol (based on ssh). To **begin an sftp session** and start transferring files you type `sftp username@filegateway.canterbury.ac.nz`, substituting in your UC username (eg. nto42). It should then ask for your password and let you in to the server.

Once on this server you can maneuver into /Research/FlanaganLab. Now we can start moving files between the RCC and the FlanaganLab server.

 1. Downloading files from FlanaganLab to RCC: use `get remote-file <local-dir>`
      - The remote-file is whatever file you are wanting to move
      - local-dir is the target directory you want to download to. If you leave it blank it will automatically download to current local directory (the RCC)
 2. Uploading files from the RCC to FlanaganLab: use `put local-file <remote-path>`
      - The local-file is whatever file you want to move from the RCC to FlanaganLab
      - Remote-path is the location of FlanaganLab (/Research/FlanaganLab)
      - If you get the error **local "XXX" is not a regular file** but `-r` after `put`

## Creating a config file for logging into the RCC
 1. Navigate into the .ssh directory

</p>
 2. Once in the .ssh directory create a config file with `nano config` \
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
##Example of how to format a config file
Host ctosto
        HostName 132.181.102.28
        User rccuser
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

 3. You can now log into the RCC with whatever name you gave it in the config file (Ex. `ssh ctosto`)


## Renaming the .fastq.gz files to get rid of unecessary info
**STARTING FORMAT** = FLG3F2_E1_S52_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz 
<p float="left"> 
<img src="C:/Users/nicol/Pictures/names_1.jpg" style="width:450px;"/>
</p>

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
##Remove the "_001" from all of the files and replace it with nothing
rename 's/_001//g' *.gz

```
<p float="left"> 
<img src="C:/Users/nicol/Pictures/names_2.jpg" style="width:450px;"/>
</p>

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
##Removing the _R1(2).fastq.gz from file names and putting those names into a file (samples.txt)
for fq in ./*_R1.fastq.gz
> do
> base=$(basename $fq _R1.fastq.gz)
> echo $base >> samples.txt
> done 

```
<p float="left"> 
<img src="C:/Users/nicol/Pictures/names_3.jpg" style="width:350px;"/>
</p>

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
##Copy the column and put that into a new file (rename.txt)
cat samples.txt | awk '{print $1"\t"$1}' >> rename.txt

##Using nano, remove the unwanted bits from the name in the SECOND column
nano rename.txt
```
<p float="left"> 
<img src="C:/Users/nicol/Pictures/names_4.jpg" style="width:350px;"/>
</p>

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
##Create a while loop to create the variables "old" and "new" for all samples
while read -r line
> do
> old=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}')
> new=$(echo $line | awk '{print $2}')
> echo $new $old
> done < rename.txt

##Apply the old and new variables to the names of the .gz files using the command 'rename'
while read -r line; do old=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}'); new=$(echo $line | awk '{print $2}'); echo $new $old
> rename "s/$old/$new/g" *.gz
> done < rename.txt 
```
