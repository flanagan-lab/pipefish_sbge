abstract = {Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex-role reversal (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species. Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene expression in these unusual fishes.}

    abstract = "{Sexual dimorphism often results from hormonally regulated trait differences between the sexes. In sex-role-reversed vertebrates, females often have ornaments used in mating competition that are expected to be under hormonal control. Males of the sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) develop female-typical traits when they are exposed to estrogens. We aimed to identify genes whose expression levels changed during the development and maintenance of female-specific ornaments. We performed RNA-sequencing on skin and muscle tissue in male Gulf pipefish with and without exposure to estrogen to investigate the transcriptome of the sexually dimorphic ornament of vertical iridescent bands found in females and estrogen-exposed males. We further compared differential gene expression patterns between males and females to generate a list of genes putatively involved in the female secondary sex traits of bands and body depth. A detailed analysis of estrogen-receptor binding sites demonstrates that estrogen-regulated genes tend to have nearby cis-regulatory elements. Our results identified a number of genes that differed between the sexes and confirmed that many of these were estrogen-responsive. These estrogen-regulated genes may be involved in the arrangement of chromatophores for color patterning, as well as in the growth of muscles to achieve the greater body depth typical of females in this species. In addition, anaerobic respiration and adipose tissue could be involved in the rigors of female courtship and mating competition. Overall, this study generates a number of interesting hypotheses regarding the genetic basis of a female ornament in a sex-role-reversed pipefish.}",

    abstract = "{In many animals, sperm competition and sexual conflict are thought to drive the rapid evolution of male-specific genes, especially those expressed in the testes. A potential exception occurs in the male pregnant pipefishes, where females transfer eggs to the males, eliminating testes from participating in these processes. Here, we show that testis-related genes differ dramatically in their rates of molecular evolution and expression patterns in pipefishes and seahorses (Syngnathidae) compared to other fish. Genes involved in testis or sperm function within syngnathids experience weaker selection in comparison to their orthologs in spawning and livebearing fishes. An assessment of gene turnover and expression in the testis transcriptome suggests that syngnathids have lost (or significantly reduced expression of) important classes of genes from their testis transcriptomes compared to other fish. Our results indicate that more than 50 million years of male pregnancy have removed syngnathid testes from the molecular arms race that drives the rapid evolution of male reproductive genes in other taxa.}",
